## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens. Protected routes use JWT middleware to extract user context. All services except auth-service require valid Authorization header. Sessions stored in Redis with configurable expiry.

### AI Agent Integration  
Supports multiple AI providers via AI_MODEL_PROVIDER env var: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (local), and LM Studio (local). The AI service integrates with browser service for task execution. Task types include navigate, extract, interact, summarize, search, fill_form, screenshot, analyze, custom. Provider-specific configurations available in `configs/ai.yaml` and documented in `docs/AI_PROVIDERS.md`.

### Browser Automation
Uses chromedp for headless Chrome automation. Session-based architecture - users create browser sessions via API. Supports element interaction, content extraction, screenshots. Configured for Docker with disabled GPU and sandbox.
